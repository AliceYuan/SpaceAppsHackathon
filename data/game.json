We now live in the 21st century, a time in which private citizens are able to dream of the stars and meaningfully contribute to humanities effort to reach for them. </p> <p>It is already clear to us that this new space renaissance will be driven by cooperation, not only between international governmental partners, but by cooperation between our traditional space agencies and private, entrepreneurial efforts aimed at commercialization of near Earth space.</p> <p>There are many players in this arena and you are one of them. You will need to learn about who is involved and how to work with them. You will also need to make decisions about missions architectures, infrastructure development, resource management amongst other issues that will pop up in building a cis lunar economy.</p>",
